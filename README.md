#CCM Volunteer Approval System

##What is this?
It's the source code to the software that runs our volunteer approval system. It includes a console app that is run on a server
with task scheduler every morning, a web app that handles the UI, and a class library that is shared between the two apps.

##Will this work out of the box?
Um, no. It's very specific to our church's needs. It requires a [Ministry Platform](http://thinkministry.com/) instance to talk to 
and a mail server.

##So why is it here?
For education purposes and to share ideas with others who are interested in what can be accomplished with Ministry Platform.

##Enjoy!
